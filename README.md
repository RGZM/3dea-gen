# 3D-EdgeAngle Generator (3dea-gen)

The scripts provided here are used to automatically create cross-sections on a 3D model with previously manually defined curve(s) (digitalisation of the edge, e.g. active edge of a lithic). Furthermore, with different approaches, the edge angles are automatically calculated on the cross-sections, which allows an analysis of the edge. The results are csv files for each profile containing the edge angle values of the different approaches.
These scripts are part of the project 3D-EdgeAngle â€“ A semi-automated 3D digital method to quantify stone tool edge angle and design.

## software

The scripts were created for the software **GOM Insprect Professional 2016**. The execution of the scripts must take place in this software. A detailed description of the methods used can be found here (not yet published): [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/xxx.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.xxx)

## data

To use the scripts you need a 3D model in stl-file and a digitized edge on the 3D model in iges-file.

You can download a sample dataset with the results of the scripts here (not yet published): [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7360011.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7360011)

## python scripts

For the naming of the data specifications have been made, which are defined in the scripts by "regular expressions" (regex). These defaults can be adjusted. The variables for this are defined in the scripts with "pattern_". 

**gom2016_3dea_1_reference_curve.py**

Creates a thinned and smoothed reference curve from the curve of the digitised edge. This is the basis for the cross profiles.

**gom2016_3dea_2_sections_SEC_NUM.py**

Calculates cross-sections based on the reference curve and the 3D model. 
The number of cross sections can be specified here. The distance between them is distributed evenly over the reference curve. 

**gom2016_3dea_2_sections_SEC_DIST.py**

Calculates cross-sections based on the reference curve and the 3D model. The distance between the cross profiles can be specified. The number of cross-sections is calculated automatically depending on the length of the reference curve.

**gom2016_3dea_3_sections_2d_projection.py**

Projects the cross-sections into a 2D plane and saves profiles as iges-file and csv-file. The cross-sections can thus also be analysed outside the GOM software.

**gom2016_3dea_4_compute_edge_angles.py**

Calculates angles on the cross sections in three different approaches. Angles are calculated at regular intervals from the digitized cutting edge. All calculated angles are saved in a csv-file.
