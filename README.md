# EAP

The scripts provided here are used to automatically create cross-sections on a 3D model and a previously manually defined curve (e.g. cutting edge). Furthermore, angles with different approaches are automatically calculated on the cross-sections, which allow an analysis of the sharpness of the edge. The results are csv files for each profile containing the angles of the different approaches.

python scripts for the gom insprect pro 2016 software

to create defined sections on a 3d mesh and constructs angels on the sections

usefull if you have a lot of cutting edges to analysing

Examples of data can be found here .....

Detailed explanation of the methods used in the scripts are documented here.....

## python scripts

### reference curve

gom2016_EAP-1_reference_curve.py 

create a reference curve

### create section


there are two approaches
- define the distance between the cross-sections
  - gom2016_EAP_2_sections_SEC_NUM
- define the number of cross-sections on the reference curve
-   - later.....
